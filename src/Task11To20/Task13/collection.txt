Q   :    why ArrayList ? how it works internally ?  what if it overflow or it is possible?
	what is the max size of ArrayList?
A   : 	Internally an ArrayList uses an Object[] . As you add items to an ArrayList , the list checks to see if the backing array has room left. 
	If there is room, the new item is just added at the next empty space. 
	If there is not room, a new, larger, array is created, and the old array is copied into the new one.



		default		growth

arraylist	10		The new capacity is calculated which is 50% more than the old capacity and the array is increased by that capacity.
linkedlist	0
vector		10		implementation-dependent
priorityqueue	11		automatically grow
hashmap		16   
hashset		16
treemap		16	
treeset		0		1
map 		16


max size of arraylist,hashset in java = 2^31

max size of linkedlist,treemap in java = 2^31 - 1

max size of map,hashmap in java = 2^30
